# 🚲 Cyclistic Bike-Share Case Study

This project is part of the Google Data Analytics Capstone. It focuses on analyzing how **casual riders** and **annual members** use Cyclistic bikes differently — with the ultimate goal of recommending data-driven strategies to **convert casual riders into members**.

- **Tableau Public** – Interactive data visualization
- **Google Sheets** – Data review and initial calculations

## 📁 Dataset
The dataset includes 12 months of historical ride data from Cyclistic (Divvy).
- Fields: `ride_id`, `member_casual`, `started_at`, `ended_at`, `ride_length`, `day_of_week`
- All trips were made using **docked bikes** (no electric or classic bikes present)

---

## 🔍 Key Insights

### 1. Casual Riders Use Bikes More on Weekdays
Contrary to expectations, casual riders are more active during **weekdays**, not weekends — suggesting a potential for commuter or habitual use rather than just leisure.

### 2. Casual Riders Have Longer Ride Durations
On average, **casual riders take longer rides** than members. This might reflect less time pressure or exploratory travel patterns.

### 3. Both User Types Use the Same Bike Type
All recorded rides were taken on **docked bikes**, so we could not analyze bike-type preferences.

## 🎯 Business Recommendations

1. **Introduce a Weekday Commuter Plan**  
   Target casual riders with a new membership tier focused on weekday rides.

2. **Promote Membership Cost Savings**  
   Highlight how frequent casual users spend more over time compared to an annual membership.

3. **Offer Trial Memberships After Repeat Usage**  
   Automatically offer free trials to casual riders after 3–5 weekday rides to encourage conversion.

## 📷 Dashboard Screenshots
See the `/Cyclistic_Dashboard_Screenshots/` folder for visual summaries of:
- Total rides by user type
- Ride duration comparison
- Usage by day of the week

## 📈 Next Steps
- Analyze a dataset that includes multiple `rideable_type` values to explore bike preferences.
- Enrich the dataset with weather, time-of-day, and location data to refine rider behavior analysis.
- Consider A/B testing different membership offers based on these insights.
