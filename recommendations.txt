Cyclistic Bike-Share Case Study: Recommendations

Objective:
Convert casual riders into annual members using data-driven strategies.

Top 3 Recommendations:

1. Launch a "Weekday Commuter Plan":
   Casual riders are most active on weekdays, not weekends. Offer a low-cost annual membership focused on weekday rides to encourage conversion.

2. Emphasize Cost Savings:
   Casual riders who ride frequently could save more by switching to an annual plan. Include ride count summaries and cost comparisons in marketing campaigns.

3. Offer Trial Memberships to Frequent Casual Riders:
   After a rider completes 3-5 trips in a month, offer a 7-day free membership trial via email or app push notification to increase likelihood of conversion.

Note:
Due to the dataset only including docked bikes, no conclusions could be made about rider preferences for electric or classic bikes.
